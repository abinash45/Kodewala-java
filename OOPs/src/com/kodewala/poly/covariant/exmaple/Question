Problem Statement
======================
A hospital wants to implement a Medical Report System in Java that can generate reports for multiple departments.
All reports share some common behavior, such as generating the report.
Different departments (like Blood Test and X-Ray) have specialized reports with additional information.
The system should support runtime polymorphism and type-safe method overriding using covariant return types.

--------------------------------------------------
Requirements

Parent Report Class (MedicalReport)

Represents a general medical report.

Method: void generate() → prints "Generating medical report".

Child Report Classes (BloodReport and XRayReport)

Extend MedicalReport.

BloodReport: method bloodDetails() → prints "Blood test details".

XRayReport: method xrayDetails() → prints "X-Ray scan details".

Parent Service Class (ReportService)

Method: MedicalReport generateReport() → prints "Generating report using general service" and returns a MedicalReport.

Child Service Classes (BloodReportService and XRayReportService)

Override generateReport() method.

Covariant return type:

BloodReportService returns BloodReport.

XRayReportService returns XRayReport.

Each method prints the corresponding service message.

Driver Class (Driver)

Demonstrate runtime polymorphism:

Parent reference (ReportService) can point to any child service.

Call overridden method and store result in parent type reference.

Downcast to access child-specific methods.

Print outputs for both Blood Report and X-Ray Report.


------------------------------------------------
Demonstrate covariant return types in Java.

Show runtime polymorphism using parent reference and child object.

Understand downcasting to access child-specific methods.

Apply object-oriented principles in a real-world hospital scenario.
