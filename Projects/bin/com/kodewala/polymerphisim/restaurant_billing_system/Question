A restaurant wants to develop a simple billing system to calculate customer bills in different scenarios. The system should support calculating the bill using only the food price, calculating the bill by adding tax to the food price, and calculating the bill by adding both tax and a service charge to the food price. The application must use compile-time polymorphism by implementing method overloading, where the same method name is used with different parameter lists. Develop a Java program that demonstrates compile-time polymorphism by calculating and displaying the final bill amount for each scenario.
