A hospital wants to develop a simple Patient Billing System 
to calculate the final bill amount for patients based on their category.
 Every patient has a base bill amount. 
 The hospital supports different types of patients such as Normal Patients, 
 who pay the base bill amount, Insurance Patients, 
 who receive a 30% discount on the base bill, and VIP Patients,
  who are charged an additional ₹2000 as a VIP fee. 
  The system must be designed using inheritance to represent different patient types,
   method overriding to calculate the final bill for each patient type,
    and runtime polymorphism by invoking the overridden calculateBill() method using a parent class reference.
     The patient data should be protected using encapsulation, and the final payable amount must be calculated using a common method named calculateBill().
